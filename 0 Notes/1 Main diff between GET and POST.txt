Q1: Why GET isnt taking the req.body if the form is posted?
Ans:- 
The issue you're encountering arises because your GET request (handled by homeController) cannot access req.body, which is only available for POST requests.

Key Points:
GET requests do not have a body. The GET method typically sends data via the URL query string (e.g., ?name=John&age=30).
POST requests send data through the request body, which you are handling correctly in your formSubmit function.

Solution:
If you want to handle form submission using the POST method, ensure the form uses method="post" (which you already have). The formSubmit function correctly handles req.body, which contains the form data. You don't need to access req.body in your homeController for the GET route.

Here's a breakdown of what should happen:

GET: The homeController renders the form when visiting the root URL (/).
POST: When the form is submitted, the formSubmit function handles the POST request, processes req.body, and redirects to /student.

Example Flow:
Visit the home page (GET /):
Renders the form using homeController.
No req.body data here (GET requests donâ€™t have a body).
Submit the form (POST /):
The formSubmit handler captures the form data from req.body.
It processes the form data and then redirects to /student.
Your current setup is correct, but the confusion likely comes from expecting req.body in the GET request. Only POST requests carry a body.
